 <h1>Play the FizzBuzz game!</h1>
 
 </p>In this variation of the original game, you can count from 1 to 100. If the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, the number will appear. If the number is divisible by 3, Fizz will appear. If the number is divisible by 5, Buzz will appear. If it's divisible by both 3 and 5, FizzBuzz will appear.<br>(So, counting from 1 to 15, you'd see: “1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz”.)<br>Ready to play?
